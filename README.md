# Minimal example of using a Web Worker with Vue in Typescript
I have forked this sample from https://github.com/dynamind/minimal-vue-worker
All I have done is converting from Javascript to Typescript.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

yarn build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
yarn lint
```
